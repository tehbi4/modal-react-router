## modal-react-router

A simple way to handle showing modals with react-router version 4.

### Installation

Install using yarn or npm.

`npm install modal-react-router --save`

or

`yarn add modal-react-router`

You will also need to install some other modules as peers.

TBH, if you are looking at this package you probably already have these, but you might want to check for version compatibility.

`react-router-dom` _version 4_

`react`, _version 15 or higher_

For ex: `yarn add react-router-dom react react-dom`.
